					<div class="text-holder">
						<p>Data-driven services and devices have profound consequences for how we think of ourselves, relate to one other, organize collective life, and envision desirable futures. UC Berkeley's Human Contexts and Ethics of Data course prepares students to use the tools of applied historical thinking and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to engage as knowledgeable, skillful, and responsible citizens and professionals in the varied arenas of our datafied world. </p>

						<p>The course meets the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of UC Berkeley's Data Science major. It gives Data Science majors systematic exposure and reflective practice in the human choices and social structures that intrinsically shape their work as data scientists. For students who do not intend to major in Data Science, the course will jumpstart your knowledge and strengthen your capacity to take part in guiding our datafied world. </p>

						<p>The course carries the broad, inclusive spirit of Berkeley’s Data Science curriculum into the area of human society and collective choices. It is offered in partnership with the Berkeley Division of Data Sciences. </p>

							Margarita (Margo) Boenig-Liptsin is a Lecturer in the History Department. She co-designs and
							co-teaches Hist C182C/STS C100 &quot;Human Contexts and Ethics of Data&quot; with Prof. Cathryn
							Carson. In addition to teaching, she is helping to develop the Human Contexts and Ethics (HCE)
							component of the data science educational program in the Division of Data Sciences. This work
							includes translating social science theory and methods for a general education audience,
							building connections between engineering and social sciences, bringing together faculty,
							graduate students, and undergraduates at Berkeley into a community of scholars focused on
							HCE issues, and connecting the work of HCE to Bay Area&#39;s communities and needs. She is
							trained in the field of Science, Technology and Society (STS) and holds a PhD in HIstory of
							Science (Harvard University) and in Philosophy (Université Paris-Sorbonne). Her research
							examines transformations to human identity, ethics, and citizenship in relation to information
							technologies from historical and cross-cultural perspectives.
