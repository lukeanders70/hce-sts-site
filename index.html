						Today&#39;s computer-powered and increasingly autonomous techniques for analyzing large,
						evolving data sets offer unprecedented promise for revolutionizing the way that people act in
						and know the world. Data-driven services and devices also shape innumerable aspects of our
						lives in unprecedented ways. These new tools and systems have profound consequences for
						how we think of ourselves, relate to one other, organize collective life, and envision desirable
						futures.
						This course teaches UC Berkeley undergraduates to use the tools of applied historical thinking
						and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to recognize, analyze, and shape the human
						contexts and ethics of data. It prepares students to engage as a knowledgeable, skillful, and
						responsible citizen and professional in the varied arenas of our datafied world.
						Students will learn to address:

						<ul>
							<li>How does data science transform how people live and how societies function?</li>
							<li>How do cultures and values inform how data science tools are developed and deployed?</li>
							<li>What assumptions do data science tools carry with them?</li>
							<li>What projections do they make on the future?</li>
							<li>How can we shape the outcomes we want to see?</li>
						</ul>

						<p><b>If you intend to major in Data </b>, the course meets the Human Contexts and Ethics
						requirement of UC Berkeley’s Data Science major. It gives you systematic exposure and
						reflective practice in the human choices and social structures that intrinsically shape your work.</p>
						
						<p><b>If you don’t intend to major in Data Science</b>, the course will jumpstart your knowledge and
						strengthen your capacity to take part in guiding our datafied world. The course carries the
						broad, inclusive spirit of Berkeley’s Data Science curriculum into the area of human society and
						collective choices.</p>

					<div class="text-holder">
						This course explores how data science is entangled with diverse human contexts (histories,
						institutions, and material bases) and ethics (domains of value-laden choice). We will bring
						historically-grounded perspectives as well as frameworks and methods from Science,
						Technology, and Society (STS) (such as cross-national comparison, co-production, and
						controversy studies) to bear on topics that include:

						<ul>
							<li>Doing ethical data science amid shifting definitions of human subjects, consent, and privacy;</li>
							<li>The changing relationship between data, democracy, and law;</li>
							<li>The role of data analytics in how corporations and governments provide public goods such as health and security to citizens;</li>
							<li>Sensors, machine learning and artificial intelligence and changing landscapes of labor,industry, and city life;</li>
							<li>The implications of data for how publics and varied scientific disciplines know the world.</li>
						</ul>

						The objective of the course is to prepare you to recognize when, where, and how data,
						analytics, and associated technologies shape and govern the human condition. The course
						aims to provide you with methods with which to think critically about human contexts and ethics
						issues of data science when you encounter them in routine work or daily life, to influence how
						data science is used to achieve better outcomes for people, and be able to articulate what
						&quot;better&quot; means.

							Margarita (Margo) Boenig-Liptsin is a Lecturer in the History Department. She co-designs and
							co-teaches Hist C182C/STS C100 &quot;Human Contexts and Ethics of Data&quot; with Prof. Cathryn
							Carson. In addition to teaching, she is helping to develop the Human Contexts and Ethics (HCE)
							component of the data science educational program in the Division of Data Sciences. This work
							includes translating social science theory and methods for a general education audience,
							building connections between engineering and social sciences, bringing together faculty,
							graduate students, and undergraduates at Berkeley into a community of scholars focused on
							HCE issues, and connecting the work of HCE to Bay Area&#39;s communities and needs. She is
							trained in the field of Science, Technology and Society (STS) and holds a PhD in HIstory of
							Science (Harvard University) and in Philosophy (Université Paris-Sorbonne). Her research
							examines transformations to human identity, ethics, and citizenship in relation to information
							technologies from historical and cross-cultural perspectives.
